# Linear-BinarySearchAlgorithms
Compares the amount of iterations it takes both Linear &amp; binary search algorithms to search for a random integer in an integer array.
1. Two Classes: Main & searchAlgorithms
2. searchAlgorithms: Linear Search checks every element in array until target is found.
                     Binary Search is a Divide&Conquor algorithm that is significantly faster.
                     If target is found in either, a print statement tells how many steps it took to find target. 
                     If target is not found, print statement tells that target was never found.
                     
3. Main: Asks user to give an array size, fills array with random integers ranging 0-1000.  
         A random target is produced ranging from 0-1000.     
         Both linear & binary search are called.
